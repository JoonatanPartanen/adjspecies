About
=====

While writing a deployment system targetting DigitalOcean_ Droplets,
the author found the largest bottleneck was finding names for the transient
test servers.

The adjective/species contrivance comes from the furry culture in general
and more directly from the site `[adjective][species]`_. It provides a
wide namespace of easy-to-remember randomness.

Everything up until the initial commit was an exercise in yak shaving and
procrastinating getting out of bed.
